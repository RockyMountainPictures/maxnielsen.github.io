                    The BC Healthcare Hub is a mobile application prototype that supports learning about and using
                    British Columbia's healthcare system. This was part of IAT 334 – Interface Design; a final group
                    project with the goal to ideate, design, and create a fully interactive prototype for international
                    students arriving to BC. Content and visual design, system logic, and user testing were all expected
                    of us. Highlights of my work included developing the underlying interface system of the MSP form,
                    conducting thematic analysis on user study data, and creating most of the application in ProtoPie.

        <div class="explanation-wrapper">
            <div>
                <p>
                    Three quarters through the project, user testing was conducted with our first prototype. After my
                    teammates conducted the user study, we had several pages of interview notes that contained tangents,
                    overly general remarks, and other fluff. We needed to get to the juicy, tangible praise and
                    criticism that interviewees provided so we can understand the state of our prototype. I was tasked
                    to return valuable, actionable insights from the study’s qualitative interview notes.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I chose to use thematic analysis as we wanted to identify common issues users had with the app and
                    understand them as high-level problems within our design strategies of the app. Thematic analysis’s
                    benefits of coding, theming, and defining problems helped in our goals.

            <div>
                <p>
                    I began to copy the raw interview notes to a Figma document, chopping multi-topic sentences into
                    single topic snippets and grouping similar quotes together, coding the information. I then
                    abstracted the data into separate themes of the application’s systems and design. This
                    did not yield any significant insights as each theme encompassed too many data points, resulting in
                    overly generalized outcomes. However, I found that many of the children of each theme shared
                    underlying similarities of visual design, content design and strategy, and system logic. So, I took
                    the initial sections and broke them down into these smaller categories.

        <h2 class="heading-underline">Reflection</h2>

        <p>
            As the project progressed, it became apparent that the group’s work was unbalanced. I took on too many
            tasks as my knowledge of web, interaction, and system design aligned with this course’s content. My
            group members also stuck to their own strengths. Next time, I will focus on developing new skills while
            acting as a mentor for others who focus on areas that I am proficient in. This way, we can distribute
            the tasks more evenly and foster better outcomes for each group member.
